# The Dawoodi Bohras: A Rich Tapestry of Faith, Heritage, and Culture

The Dawoodi Bohras, a global Muslim community with roots tracing back to the Fatimi Imams of Egypt, are a testament to the harmonious blend of tradition and modernity. With a population of around one million, the Dawoodi Bohras have established thriving communities in over 40 countries, contributing positively to the societies they inhabit while preserving their unique cultural and religious identity.

## A Legacy of Leadership

The Dawoodi Bohras are led by the al-dai al-mutlaq, an unrestricted missionary who serves as the spiritual and temporal leader of the community. The current al-dai al-mutlaq, His Holiness Dr. Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin, is the 53rd in a line of leaders that dates back to the time of the Fatimi Imams. The al-dai al-mutlaq's role is to guide the community, preserve the faith, and foster harmony and goodwill among the Bohras and with the wider world.

## A Faith Rooted in Peace and Love

The Dawoodi Bohras follow the Fatimi Ismaili Tayyibi school of thought, which emphasizes peace, love, and humanity. Central to their faith is the belief in one deity, Allah Ta'ala, and the teachings of the Holy Quran. They also believe in the sacred mission of the Prophets and their successors, and the importance of adhering to the pillars of Islam.

The Dawoodi Bohras hold a deep reverence for the ahl al-bayt, the family of the Prophet Mohammed, viewing them as the rightful successors of the Prophet and guides of mankind. This belief in continuous spiritual guidance is embodied in the office of the al-dai al-mutlaq, who leads the community during the seclusion of the imam.

## A Rich Heritage

The Dawoodi Bohras have a rich historical legacy that traces back to the Fatimi Imams, direct descendants of the Prophet Mohammed. The Fatimi Imams were renowned for their leadership, scholarship, and contributions to art and culture. They founded the city of Cairo and established al-Azhar University, the oldest institution of its kind in the world.

The Dawoodi Bohras take their name from the 27th Dai Syedna Dawood bin Qutubshah, whose rightful claim to the office of dawa was recognized by Emperor Akbar. The term 'Bohra' is a Gujarati word for traders and businessmen, reflecting the community's long-standing entrepreneurial spirit.

## A Distinct Culture

The Dawoodi Bohras have a unique culture that is reflected in their language, dress, cuisine, and traditions. They speak Lisan al-Dawat, a language that combines elements of Arabic, Persian, Urdu, and Gujarati. Men traditionally wear a white three-piece outfit and a cap with golden designs, while women wear a two-piece dress called the rida, which is distinguishable by its bright colors and decorative patterns.

The Dawoodi Bohras are also known for their communal dining tradition, where meals are shared in groups around a large metal plate called a thal. This custom strengthens family and community bonds and is a testament to their spirit of unity and peace.

## A Commitment to Education and Business

The Dawoodi Bohras place a high value on education and have thriving careers in a range of industries. Women in the community play an equal role in pursuing education and careers, reflecting the community's commitment to gender equality.

The Dawoodi Bohras are also known for their business acumen and ethical trading practices. Their reputation for honesty, fairness, and trustworthiness has earned them respect in the business world and has contributed to their prosperity.

## A Community of Congregation and Pilgrimage

The Dawoodi Bohras regularly gather for majlis, or congregations, for the remembrance of Allah. These gatherings foster a sense of fellowship and brotherhood within the community. They also perform the obligatory pilgrimage of Hajj and visit the shrines of revered leaders as part of their religious tradition.

In conclusion, the Dawoodi Bohras are a vibrant community that seamlessly blends tradition and modernity. Their commitment to their faith, heritage, and culture, coupled with their contributions to society, make them a unique and integral part of the global Muslim community.
