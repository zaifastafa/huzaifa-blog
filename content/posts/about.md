```php
echo 'Hello World!';
```

As we all have started working from somewhere, for me, it was as a freelance
content writer. I used to write articles, dissertations, academic papers, 
researching and writing on keyword specific topics, promoting products and services, 
philosophical and inspirational posts, etc .. etc .. you know, the general drill. 

I even had a blog before called **Covert Cryptic** where I used to write about decrypting 
the mysteries of our thoughts. 

But all that ended a decade ago as I started my bachelors' studies in
Computer Science, as I was always facinated by programming since a young age. 

I remember I used to code web pages using `html` and `css`, and used to code my 
favourite story books into those pages. It was like magic. 
My first program was a `javascript` math function - isn't that everyone's? :smirk:

All that later on turned into a professional career, and I am so glad I took this path. I could not be happier. As the
famous Mark Twain said

> Find a job you enjoy doing, and you will never have to work a day in your life.

Yes, sometimes, I miss writing too, so to re-kindle that love affair, I have created this blog where I will attempt to 
combine two things that I love doing:

1. Writing
2. Coding

So here I will write about whatever I feel like sharing - But not only limited to that, as I will also

- talk about topics related to [Shopware](https://www.shopware.com)
- provide code snippets which you might find useful
- give tips and tricks based on my experience in the industry
- share useful resources that would help you in your development journey
- talk about different technologies and stacks

And as [Scott Cook](https://www.forbes.com/profile/scott-cook/) says:

> We're still in the first minutes of the first day of the Internet revolution.

Hence, there's a lot to look forward to.
