# Kick-Start Your Shopware 5 → Shopware 6 Migration

Moving from Shopware 5 to Shopware 6 can feel daunting, even for an experienced **developer**.
The new platform brings a modern API-first core, Symfony underpinnings, and a refreshed admin.
This guide walks you through a basic but production-ready **migration**, showing the main tasks, common pitfalls, and the tools Shopware provides.
By the end you’ll have your catalog, customers, and orders running on Shopware 6—and a clear path for further custom work.

## 1. Audit Your Current Shopware 5 Store

Every successful **shopware migration** starts with a solid inventory of what you have. Log into the SW5 backend and list:

- Installed plugins (note any custom extensions)
- Number of products, variants, manufacturers
- Customer groups, price rules, promotion logic
- Theme overrides in `/themes/Frontend`

Export this data to a spreadsheet so you can tick items off later.
If you maintain the project in Git, tag the current state (`git tag sw5-final-backup`).
This step protects you from surprises and helps you estimate effort where plugins lack a Shopware 6 counterpart.

## 2. Spin Up a Clean Shopware 6 Environment

For anything more than a hobby shop you should run Shopware 6 on PHP 8.2+, MySQL 8, and at least 4 GB RAM.
As a **developer** you have three common options:

1. **Docker:** clone `shopware/production` and run `docker compose up`
2. **Local LAMP/LEMP:** good for debugging Xdebug sessions
3. **Cloud sandbox:** Shopware Cloud offers a free tier—handy for demos

After installation, create an admin account and keep credentials safe.
Run `bin/console system:generate-jwt-secret` so API calls work, then enable the *Migration Assistant* plugin from the Store.

## 3. Configure the Migration Assistant

The Migration Assistant is the official bridge between versions.
Open **Settings → Migration**, click *Add connection*, choose `Shopware 5` as the source, and enter the SW5 database credentials plus the live shop URL.
On the old shop, install the companion plugin *SwagMigrationConnector* and clear caches.

> **Tip for devs:** If you can’t expose your local DB, set an SSH tunnel:
> `ssh -L 3308:127.0.0.1:3306 user@sw5-server`

Back in Shopware 6, run the *pre-checks*. The wizard flags incompatible plugins or large media folders that could stall the first pass.
Fix red items before continuing; amber items are warnings only.

## 4. Migrate Data in Manageable Batches

Click *Start migration* and select the data you need: Products, Categories, Customers, Orders, SEO URLs, Media.
For a basic store, migrate everything except Logs and Statistics. The assistant shows a live progress bar.
Under the hood it transfers data to temporary JSON files, validates them against Shopware 6 schemas, then writes to the DB.

If you’re moving thousands of products, split the job: first migrate *Products & Categories*, then *Customers & Orders*.
This keeps PHP memory low and lets your team test each chunk sooner. Should the process stop, click *Resume*; the assistant is idempotent and will pick up where it left off.

## 5. Verify, Theme, and Go Live

Once data lands in Shopware 6, open the new storefront preview. Check that:

- All categories appear in the navigation
- Product detail pages show correct prices and variations
- Customer accounts list past orders
- Media loads from the `/media/` folder, not `/files/`

Design-wise, Shopware 6 swaps the old Smarty theme for Twig blocks.
If you had heavy Twig overrides in SW5, port them one component at a time (`@Storefront/storefront/page/product-detail` is a good start).
Keep styles in PostCSS or Tailwind; both compile cleanly with the Storefront build pipeline.

## Closing Thoughts

Migration finished? Take a breath, then start exploring what Shopware 6 really offers—rule-based promotions, Flow Builder automations, and a headless-ready API that can power anything from PWAs to in-store kiosks.
By nailing the basics today you’ve laid a future-proof foundation that your team, and your customers, will feel every time they click “Add to cart.”
