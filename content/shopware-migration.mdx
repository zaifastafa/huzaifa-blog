        Kick-Start Your Shopware 5 → Shopware 6 Migration
    </h1>

    <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Moving from Shopware 5 to Shopware 6 can feel daunting, even for an experienced <strong>developer</strong>.
        The new platform brings a modern API-first core, Symfony underpinnings, and a refreshed admin.
        This guide walks you through a basic but production-ready <strong>migration</strong>,
        showing the main tasks, common pitfalls, and the tools Shopware provides.
        By the end you’ll have your catalog, customers, and orders running on
        Shopware 6—and a clear path for further custom work.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-3">
        1. Audit Your Current Shopware 5 Store
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Every successful <strong>shopware migration</strong> starts with a solid inventory of what you have.
        Log into the SW5 backend and list:
    </p>

    <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li>Installed plugins (note any custom extensions).</li>
        <li>Number of products, variants, manufacturers.</li>
        <li>Customer groups, price rules, promotion logic.</li>
        <li>Theme overrides in <code>/themes/Frontend</code>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Export this data to a spreadsheet so you can tick items off later.
        If you maintain the project in Git, tag the current state (<code>git tag sw5-final-backup</code>).
        This step protects you from surprises and helps you estimate effort where
        plugins lack a Shopware 6 counterpart.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-3">
        2. Spin Up a Clean Shopware 6 Environment
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        For anything more than a hobby shop you
        should run Shopware 6 on PHP 8.2+, MySQL 8, and at least 4 GB RAM.
        As a <strong>developer</strong> you have three common options:
    </p>

    <ol className="list-decimal ml-6 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Docker:</strong> Clone <code>shopware/production</code> and run <code>docker compose up</code>.</li>
        <li><strong>Local LAMP/LEMP:</strong> Good for debugging Xdebug sessions.</li>
        <li><strong>Cloud sandbox:</strong> Shopware Cloud offers a free tier—handy for demos.</li>
    </ol>

    <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        After installation, create an admin account and keep credentials safe.
        Do <code>bin/console system:generate-jwt-secret</code> so API calls work,
        then enable the <em>Migration Assistant</em> plugin from the Store.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-3">
        3. Configure the Migration Assistant
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        The Migration Assistant is the official bridge between versions.
        You’ll find it under <strong>Settings → Migration</strong>.
        Click <em>Add Connection</em>, choose <code>Shopware 5</code> as the source,
        and enter the SW5 database credentials plus the live shop URL.
        The assistant pings an API endpoint called the <em>SwagMigrationConnector</em>.
        Install that connector in Shopware 5 like any other plugin and clear caches.
    </p>

    <div className="bg-gray-100 rounded p-4 mb-6 text-sm">
        <strong>Tip for devs:</strong> If you can’t expose your local DB, set an SSH tunnel:<br/>
        <code>ssh -L 3308:127.0.0.1:3306 user@sw5-server</code>
    </div>

    <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Back in Shopware 6, run the <em>pre-checks</em>. The wizard flags incompatible plugins,
        or large media folders that could stall the first pass.
        Fix red items before continuing; amber items are warnings only.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-3">
        4. Migrate Data in Manageable Batches
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Click <em>Start migration</em> and select the data sets you need:
        Products, Categories, Customers, Orders, SEO URLs, Media.
        For a basic store, migrate everything except Logs and Statistics.
        The assistant shows a live progress bar.
        Under the hood it transfers data to temporary JSON files,
        validates them against Shopware 6 schemas, then writes to the DB.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        If you’re moving thousands of products, split the job:
        first migrate <em>Products &amp; Categories</em>, then <em>Customers &amp; Orders</em>.
        This keeps PHP memory low and lets your team test each chunk sooner.
        Should the process stop, click <em>Resume</em>;
        the assistant is idempotent and will pick up where it left off.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-3">
        5. Verify, Theme, and Go Live
    </h2>

    <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Once data lands in Shopware 6, open the new storefront preview.
        Check that:
    </p>

    <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li>All categories appear in the navigation.</li>
        <li>Product detail pages show correct prices and variations.</li>
        <li>Customer accounts list past orders.</li>
        <li>Media loads from the <code>/media/</code> folder, not <code>/files/</code>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Design-wise, Shopware 6 swaps the old Smarty theme for Twig blocks.
        If you had heavy Twig overrides in SW5, port them one component at a time
        (<code>@Storefront/storefront/page/product-detail</code> is a good start).
        Keep styles in PostCSS or Tailwind; both compile cleanly with the Storefront build pipeline.
    </p>

    <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
        Migration finished? Take a breath, then start exploring what Shopware 6 really offers—rule-based promotions, Flow Builder automations, and a headless-ready API that can power anything from PWAs to in-store kiosks. By nailing the basics today you’ve laid a future-proof foundation that your team, and your customers, will feel every time they click “Add to cart.”
