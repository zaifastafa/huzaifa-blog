Every journey has a starting point. For me, my professional journey took off as a freelance content and copywriter. The scope of my work spanned writing articles, dissertations, academic papers, and promoting products and services through keyword-specific content. I also indulged in writing philosophical and inspirational posts, among other things - a routine that was as diverse as it was engaging.

Before delving deeper into my career path, I ran a blog called **Covert Cryptic**. This was my creative space where I indulged in unraveling the enigmas of human thoughts - a pursuit that was as intriguing as it sounds!

However, a decade ago, my life took a significant turn. I started my bachelor's studies in Computer Science, a field that had always intrigued me since I was a child. I would dabble in creating web pages using `HTML` and `CSS` and found joy in transforming my favorite storybooks into these pages. It was a mesmerizing experience, akin to magic. My first stint with coding was a simple JavaScript math function - a common starting point for many, I believe!

This initial fascination with programming eventually evolved into a full-fledged professional career, a decision that I could not be happier about. In the wise words of [Mark Twain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Twain):

    <p>"Find a job you enjoy doing, and you will never have to work a day in your life."</p>
</div>


While I sometimes miss writing, I have decided to revisit this old passion by setting up this blog. Here, I aim to merge my love for coding and writing. This space will reflect a blend of my interests, where I will:

1. Share my thoughts on topics that pique my interest.
2. Discuss topics related to [Shopware](https://www.shopware.com), my area of expertise.
3. Share industry-based tips and tricks.
4. Provide code snippets that might come in handy.
5. Share valuable resources to aid your development journey.
6. Discuss different technologies and stacks I encounter.

As [Scott Cook](https://www.forbes.com/profile/scott-cook/) rightly said:

    <p>"We're still in the first minutes of the first day of the Internet revolution."</p>
</div>

We certainly have a lot to look forward to!
